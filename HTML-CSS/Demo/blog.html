          Software development refers to a set of computer science activities
          dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and
          supporting software. Software itself is the set of instructions or
          programs that tell a computer what to do. It is independent of
          hardware and makes computers programmable.<br>
          <h2>There are three basictypes:</h2> 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>System software</li>
          <li>Programming software</li>
          <li>Application software</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b><em>System Software:</em></b>
          to provide core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management and other operational necessities.
        </p>
        <p><b><em>Programming Software:</em></b>
          to give programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers and other tools to create code.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><em>Application Software:</em></b>
          (applications or apps) to help users perform tasks. Office productivity suites, data management software, media players and security programs are examples. Applications also refers to web and mobile applications like those used to shop on Amazon.com, socialize with Facebook or post pictures to Instagram.

        </p>
        <h2>Steps in the software development process</h2>
        <p>The steps of the software development process fit into application lifecycle management (ALM).</p>
        <br>
        <p><b><em>Selecting a methodology:</em></b>
          to establish a framework in which the steps of software development are applied. It describes an overall work process or roadmap for the project. Methodologies can include Agile development, DevOps, Rapid Application Development (RAD), Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Waterfall and others.</p>
          <p><b><em>Gathering requirements:</em></b>
            to understand and document what is required by users and other stakeholders.</p>
            <p><b><em>Choosing or building an architecture:</em></b>
              as the underlying structure within which the software will operate.</p>
              <p><b><em>Developing a design:</em>
              </b>
              around solutions to the problems presented by requirements, often involving process models and storyboards.
              </p>
              <p><b><em>Building a model :</em></b>
                with a modeling tool that uses a modeling language like SysML or UML to conduct early validation, prototyping and simulation of the design.
              </p>
              <p><b><em>Constructing code:</em></b>
              in the appropriate programming language. Involves peer and team review to eliminate problems early and produce quality software faster.</p>
              <p><b><em>Testing</em></b>
                with pre-planned scenarios as part of software design and coding ‚Äî and conducting performance testing to simulate load testing on the applicatio.</p>
                <p><b><em>Deploying </em></b>
                  the software for use and responding to and resolving user problems.
